How do Face Recognition based Attendance Systems Work?
Face recognition technology involves analyzing and identifying a person’s facial features using advanced algorithms.
It captures and compares unique facial characteristics, such as the distance between the eyes, the shape of the nose, and the contours of the face.
This technology has come a long way and is now capable of near-instantaneous recognition with remarkable accuracy.
They use a camera to capture an individual’s face, analyze the facial features, and compare them with a database of pre-registered faces.
If a match is found, attendance is recorded. These systems can also adapt to variations in lighting, facial expressions, and aging, ensuring reliability.
